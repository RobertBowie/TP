/*
The name of the function in this example is "mergesorted".
It should return a big sorted array from two smaller sorted arrays: e.g.

mergesorted([1,2],[3,4]) //should: [1,2,3,4]

mergesorted([1,2],[3]) //should: [1,2,3]

mergesorted([1],[2, 3]) //should: [1,2,3]

Since this function is being used in an algorithm, try to optimize for
speed and browse the solutions when you're done to see how others approached
the problem.

// TODO: implement 'mergesorted'
// assume: a and b are both arrays, consisting entirely of integers,
// both arrays are sorted and contain at least 1 integer.
// Do not use Array.sort
function mergesorted(a, b) {
